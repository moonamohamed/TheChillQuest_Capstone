The Chill Quest is a fun habit tracker that turns tasks in quests, rewarding you with XP: experience points and levels as you complete them. 
It's built with React on the frontend and Node.js with MongoDB on the backend, using JWT for secure login.
The app features a colorful, accessible design, personalized avatars, and animated XP progress bar.
to access the dashboard/questlog, users must register and login to receive a JWT token, which is stored locally and required for protected routes.
Future improvements may include badges, reminders, and mobile responsiveness.
